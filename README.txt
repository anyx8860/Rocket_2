Files to look at are code_2_retrieving.ipynb, visualization_1.ipynb, and visualization_2.ipynb

Overview: First was gathering the data for our Projects. The tool we used was an API url to gather information on rocket launches. From this tool we created a pickle file. Dataframe was obtained through the pickle file. From this dataframe we obtained visualizations of the data.

cod_2_retrieving.ipynb: Was responsible for retrieving information and putting into a pickle file. Then the pickle file was used in visualization 1 and 2.

Visualization_1.ipynb: has graphs Rocket Lauch Successes/Failures per Year, Number of Rocket Launches, and Rocket Lauch Failures per Decade. 


Visualization_2.ipynb: consist of thermal maps about rocket launch failures and successes and the following graphs-Rocket Launch Failures per Country, Rocket Launch Failures per Country per Decade, Rocket Launch Successes per Country per Decade, and Total Rocket Launches per Country per Decade.For obtaining some of the graphs, we had to export data into csv files - out.csv, saf.csv, safwan.csv
